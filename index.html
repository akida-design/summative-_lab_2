        <h2>About me</h2>
        <section>
            <p>I am currently a rookie front-end web developer who loves turning bold ideas into clean and responsive experiences.
                With a background in HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT, I build sites that work smoothly on any device and am always hunting
                for the next challenge.
                When I'm not coding, you'll find me hanging out with friends, travelling and geeking out over
                the latest web frameworks.

                    <p>This is a simple class assignment that I did. It is a Javascript calculator that
                        is used for operations such as; summation, division, multiplication and subtraction.

                    <p>This is my very first website, a travel blog. It was a class assignment that tested
                        my proficiency in html 5. I really enjoyed building this as a first project.
